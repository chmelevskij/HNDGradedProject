# HND Graded Unit Project
## WebSocket Pong
This is web based application using real time networking with
websockets and mobile device accelerometer as input to implement
the simple pong. I was made solely for college project.

## Structure
A little bit on how project is layed out:

* Notes - some notes taken in development.
* Logging - small package used for logging of the system. It has
  actual implementation of logging and holds log files generated by
  last execution of application.
* All the files in root directory is the main server side
  application. Main.go is the entry point of application.
* Public - this folder is served by server to browser.
    + At the root of this folder there is HTML for main parts of the
      app.
    + static/js - javascript for each of the parts.
    + static/scss - styling of the application in sass syntax.
    + static/css - this css is autogenerated from sass files.
* Samples - small scripts and experiments. Also examples from some frameworks.
