First tests were done with multiple users connecting to the local
server. It was a slightly modified example application allowing users to
edit content of the text box at the same time. No. of users: 3; Visible
latency is about 0.5s when users are allowed to input at the same time.
Bounced signals overwrite typed in content.

NOTE: Snapshot of representation has to be calculated in the back end
and sent to user calculated 0.5s back in time.  Check out linear
interpolation for that.

Now users can connect and play the game. There are two options once
connected keyboard device motion to control the paddles. Projection has to
be connected first and then users. By using users id paddles side is
assigned. 

Also instead of passing raw bytes now JSON is used for messages. One
problem which has apeared is connection closes if one of the peers is idle
for some period of time. Reason may be that once ping message is received
pong message is not sent properly.

branch 'unique-users' was merged into the master and tested. Problems
which occured last week have disappeared after reseting client.go to the
last commit. Now controller page can use device motion and keyboard if
it's available. First test was done with two mobile devices ipad and
android phone.

In order to play devices have to be connected in following order:
1. Rendering screen.
2. Left player.
3. Right player.

Also controllers now display connection information.
